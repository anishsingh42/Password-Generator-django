# Password-Generator
## Overview:
The goal of the project is to create a web application that generates secure passwords for users. The application will have a simple user interface with a form that allows users to specify the length of the password, as well as which types of characters should be included (e.g. lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters).The backend of the application will be built using Django, a popular web framework for Python. The Django app will receive the user's input from the frontend, generate a random password based on the specified length and character types, and return the password to the frontend. Additional features that can be added to the project include the ability to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
## Problem Statement:
1. The need for strong and secure passwords to protect sensitive information and accounts from unauthorized access.
2. The importance of using a password generator to create strong, random passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
3. The lack of user-friendly and customizable password generators available online, leading to a need for a customized solution.
4. The importance of user input and customization in the password generator, such as allowing users to select which character sets to include in the generated password and specifying the length of the password.

## Features 
1. Password Length: Allow the user to specify the length of the password they want to generate. This can be done using an input field in the frontend, and retrieving the value in the backend.
2. Character Set: Allow the user to specify what types of characters should be included in the generated password. This can be done using checkboxes or toggles for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3. Copy to Clipboard: Allow the user to easily copy the generated password to their clipboard by clicking a button.
